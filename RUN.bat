REM  Zero Counter - launches RuneLite with this plugin compiled in.
REM
REM  The first run downloads Gradle and the RuneLite client. That is a few
REM  hundred megabytes and takes a few minutes; every run after it starts in
REM  seconds. Your normal RuneLite settings and Plugin Hub plugins are all
REM  still there - this is the same client, just with one extra plugin.
REM
REM  JAGEX ACCOUNT: a client started this way cannot log in through the Jagex
REM  Launcher. RuneLite's official way around that is in README.md under
REM  "Jagex account" - do that once, before the first run.
REM
REM  If login fails with "cannot log in": the --insecure-write-credentials
REM  flag has been removed from the Jagex Launcher on this machine, on
REM  purpose - it writes the launcher session to .runelite/credentials.properties
REM  in the clear. To develop, put it back temporarily:
REM    1. "RuneLite (configure)" -> Client arguments -> add
REM       --insecure-write-credentials -> Save
REM    2. Launch RuneLite once through the Jagex Launcher
REM    3. Remove the flag again and Save
REM    4. RUN.bat now logs in using the written credentials
REM  When finished developing, delete .runelite/credentials.properties.
REM  "End sessions" on runescape.com account settings invalidates it too.
